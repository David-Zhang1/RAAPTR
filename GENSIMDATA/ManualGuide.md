# GENSIMDATA
This is the main function for generating simulated PTA data realizations with multiple SMBHB sources. 
## Usage
```
gensimdata(/path/to/inputfile,/path/to/inputdata,/path/to/output_folder)
```
inputfile (need a better name) is a file containing ?
inputdata (need a better name) is a file containing ?
output_folder is the folder where the simulated data realizations will be stored as .mat files.
## How to generate your own inputfile
See 'test_gensimdata.m' for an example of how to create the inputfile. This script produces an inputfile called ? 
'parameters.m' file you can change some parameters of observation.

## Input data
The input data is 'survey_ska.mat' (We need to write some more stuff about it).
