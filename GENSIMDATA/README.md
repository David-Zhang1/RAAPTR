This folder contains the code for generating simulated Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data. The data from a PTA is a collection of the timing residuals from Np pulsars. The code generates statistically independent realizations of PTA data and stores them in files.
This folder contains the code for generating simulated Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data. The data from a PTA is a collection of the timing residuals from Np pulsars. The code generates statistically independent realizations of PTA data and stores them in files.

The main code is **gensimdata.m**, which generates data realizations of two types, namely,  signal+noise ('H1 data')   and noise-only ('H0 data'). In each file, the timing residuals for all the pulsars are generated with the same start and end times, and the same sampling rate. 

The noise in each timing residual is assumed to consist of only radiometer and jitter noise, each of which is well approximated as Gaussian white noise, because these are expected to be the dominant sources of noise for timing residuals obtained with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). At present, the noise standard deviation (sd) is assumed to be 100 nano-seconds (ns) for each pulsar. The GW signal in each timing residual arises from a set of Ns Supermassive Black Hole Binaries (SMBHBs) scattered across the Universe. (Currently, Ns=100 in the codes.)

The data files generated by **gensimdata.m** are stored in a user-specified output_folder. The contents of this folder are the following set of files.

(1) The file GWB_Srlz1.mat contains information about the particular simulation. This info may have some overlap with that cointained in the H1/H0 data files for ease of subsequent analysis.

(2) The set of H1 data files.


(3) The set of H0 data files. 

The names of the variables stored in H0 and H1 data files are substantially the same. The type of data stored in each file is specified in the variable **genHypothesis** which takes the values 'H1' or 'H0'.
