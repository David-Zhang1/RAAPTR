This is a list of things to do.

- [x] Convert simulator_ska_gwb.m from a script to a function so that currently hard-coded values (such as Np, Ns, etc.) can be specified as input arguments by the user. The input argument list should include the names of the output folders (currently also hard-coded). It is best to provide the input in the form of a structure.

- [ ] Once simulator_ska_gwb.m is made into a function, improve the documentation and write it in the style of help comments found for in-built Matlab functions. This should include a description of how to call the function and its input/output arguments.

- [ ] All fundamental constants should be read from only one source in RAAPTR. Create a function that returns these fundamental constants.
